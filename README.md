# Project Details

## Project Title: SkinBlissðŸŒ·

## Team Member: Fabiola Vedra. I plan to develop this software independently, thus I will perform all the tasks on my own.

## Problem Statement:
In our nation there are many skincare product distribution companies, or to put it more specifically, internet businesses. These companies distribute various brands, but they are all afflicted by the same issue: a lack of customer transparency. What does this mean? Most of the time, we have observed that the online companies that we mentionedÂ earlier provide their clients with goods that they may not even need, or worse, that are not beneficial for their particular issue or face type, all in the name of making a profit. You might be wondering why the clients don't visit a dermatologist at this point. Dermatologists are not very common here in Albania, where we consider them to be not necessary as well as expensive. Also as there are a lot of cases where dermatologists have caused also bigger problems, than to have actually helped clients with their issue. In addition, dermatologists are typically more helpful with more severe cases of skin issues than with people who just want to maintain their skin or have minor issues that can be resolved with the right products. This brings us to a list of all the online retailers of skincare products. As we previously mentioned, many of them are not transparentÂ with their customers and may not provide the correct solution for their needs, instead offering them something that they already mayÂ have in stock.

## Solution Proposed:
I've decidedÂ to develop aÂ software that will allow customers to browse a wide range of products from different brands,from the most affordable to the most luxurious,Â categorizedÂ by function,Â effect, price, reviews ets. This E-commerce platform tends to help customers choose the right products for their skin issues by offering a user-friendly interface, problem-based recommendations, and a curated selection of products that help to diverse skin concerns.

## Project Scope:
- **Aim:** Establishing software that offers a wide range of products and, at the same time, a vast database of information about every skin condition and the products that are best suited to address. Thus, weÂ will help users to make safe and informed skincare decisions, minimizingÂ the possibility of misinformationÂ coming from other sources and fostering confidence in users during their shopping experience.

- **Main Objectives:**
1. Quick Solutions Access: Developing a reliable website where people can easily and rapidly find solutions to their skin issues, free from external influences while having information available for every scenario possible.
2. User-Friendly Software: Create a user-friendly software that will be easy to use by all customers.
3. Optimized Shopping Visibility: Optimize user's shopping experience by improving the visibility of products through specific placement and search optimization, for faster and efficient product discovery.
4. Trustworthy Reviews Section: Increase the website's credibility by adding a review section where actual clients can post feedback and reviews about each product, helping new buyersÂ make informed decisions.
5. Transparency: We're here to redefine standards and ensure your skincare choices are backed by reliable, no-nonsense information, and most importantly not influenced by other people, besides yourself. 
6. Diverse Product Range: Expand the product catalog to serve to a diverse range of skin concerns and types.
7. High Privacy and Security: Provide theÂ highest levels of user privacy and data security by usingÂ user authentication, strong password requirements,Â and other advanced security features.

- **Application Description:**
SkinBlissðŸŒ·- A versatile online shopping platform with user authentication,extensive item catalog, and user-friendly experience!âœ¨
As previously pointed out, I plan to create a web applicationÂ that will include a wide variety of skincareÂ products. The website will start with a home page that will contain the information for the web aplilication and will lead to the other pages. The software will be divided into categories dedicated to various skin problems. Within each section will be product recommendations for each step of the skincare routine, from cleansersÂ to face creams, serums, masks, and so on. Additionally, each product will be categorizedÂ for its own purpose; for example, cleansers of various brands will be placed in the cleansers category, moisturizersÂ in their category, etc. But, for those who already know what they want to buy, we will create a search bar. Each client will have the ability to set up an account, which they can use to log in and place orders at a later time. To create an account the user will need credentials such as, name, surname, phone number, email and password, while to log in again will only be needed the username, or phone number and the password. On the order page, you can see the products you have already added to your card and change their quantity.  Next, users will fill out their address information and can confirm the order. Additionally, the user has access to see orders that have already been placed and those that are currently being delivered. It will offer to the users ease on choosing what they need and safety for their data and private informations. This is an overview of the web application's most significant features; it will have additional features as well.

 ## **Application Specifications:**
   1. Architecture:

The system will follow a client-server architecture, with a web server hosting the application and serving client requests. The system follows the client-server RESTful API communication with HTTPS connections.

`	`The system architecture utilizes a modern approach, using a combination of frontend and backend technologies to create an e-commerce skincare platform. The frontend is developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the React.js library, providing a dynamic and interactive user interface. On the backend, Node.js and Express.js handle the server-side logic and REST API endpoints, ensuring efficient data processing between the client and server. The MySQL database is utilized to store and manage product information, user data, and order details, complying ACID requirements. Security measures such as encryption using SSL/TLS and JWT for authentication are implemented to guard sensitive information and authenticate user access. Overall, this architecture enables the creation of a secure and responsive e-commerce platform tailored to meet the needs of skincare product shoppers.

 ## Technologies Used:
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js.
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js.
- Database: MySQL.
- Security: Encryption (SSL/TLS), JWT for authentication.


1. **Frontend:**
   1. **HTML, CSS, JavaScript:** These are fundamental web development languages used to create the structure, style, and interactivity of web pages. HTML provides the structure, CSS handles styling, and JavaScript adds interactivity.
   1. **React.js:** React.js is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It offers component-based architecture and a rich ecosystem of libraries and tools. React.js was chosen for its performance, reusability, and ease of managing complex UI components in a modular manner.
1. **Backend:**
   1. **Node.js:** Node.js is a runtime environment that allows JavaScript to be executed on the server-side. Node.js was chosen for its efficiency, scalability, and ecosystem libraries.
   1. **Express.js:** Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js. It simplifies routing and request handling, making it ideal for building RESTful APIs and handling HTTP requests/responses.
1. **Database:**
   1. **MySQL:** MySQL is a popular open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) known for its reliability, scalability, and performance. It provides features such as ACID compliance, transaction support, and data security. MySQL was chosen for its stability, scalability, and compatibility with the chosen technology stack.
1. **Security:**
   1. **Encryption (SSL/TLS):** SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security) protocols are used to encrypt data transmitted between the client and server, ensuring confidentiality and integrity. They provide secure communication over the internet, protecting sensitive information from eavesdropping and tampering. SSL/TLS encryption was chosen to secure data transmission and protect user privacy.
   1. **JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication:** JWT is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. It is commonly used for authentication and authorization in web applications. JWT provides a stateless authentication mechanism, enabling secure and efficient user authentication without the need for server-side sessions. It was chosen for its simplicity, scalability, and suitability for modern web application architectures.


## **User Interface Design:**

   ![image](https://github.com/fabiolavedra/SE_Project_PhaseI_TeamX/assets/161859934/c37937d4-ecb4-4f1a-8465-04db83164973)
   
**A short overview of the software interface:**
The client will have the ability to create an account and then login/out of the account. After login in it will appear the frontpage with all the products displayed in different categories, from which the user can select products to check and add to the cart/basket. The user can see the cartsâ€™ content, change the quality of the cartâ€™s products, and finally check in by adding all his/her information which will be strictly confidential. A user can check by their account the previous orders, orders status, or products saved. On the other hand, the admin can add or remove products from the software and also can view the customers' orders, and their status as well as cancel them.

**Homepage:**
The layout of the homepage will be simple and visually appealing. The first thing users will notice is the sectioning created for the various skin conditions, each of which will direct them to a separate page with the relevant information. Additionally, each product's other categories will be displayed on the side. Users can access different sections of the website, such as product categories, account management, and shopping carts, by using the navigation menus located at the top or side of the page.

**Product Listings:**
Skincare products will be shown in product listings in a list or grid format. There will be an image, title, price, rating, and a brief description for every product. Users can click on a product to view the additional details. On the other hand customer reviews and ratings will be displayed to help the other users make informed purchasing decisions.

**Shopping Cart:**
Products from product listings or details pages can be added to users' shopping carts with just one click. The shopping cart page will display a summary of all selected items, including quantities, prices, and subtotal. Users can adjust quantities, remove items, or proceed to checkout directly from the shopping cart.

**Checkout Process:**
Users will be guided through the necessary steps to finish their purchase during the checkout process. The user will securely submit payment information, choose a shipping method, and enter their shipping address. Before completing the purchase, you can review the order summary and total cost. Users will receive an email with order details and a confirmation message after the process is successful.

**User Account:**
Registered users can view order history, manage addresses, and update personal data via their account dashboard. Users will be able to change communication preferences and email notification settings through their account settings. Users can log in or sign up for an account easily from any page of the website.


## Security Measures:

**Encryption (SSL/TLS):** Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols are used to encrypt data transmitted between the client and server, ensuring confidentiality and integrity. This encryption mechanism protects sensitive information, such as user credentials and payment details, from eavesdropping and tampering during transmission over the internet.

**Authentication (JWT):** JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are utilized for authentication, providing a stateless mechanism for verifying the identity of users. JWT tokens are generated upon successful login and include user authentication data, such as user ID and roles. These tokens are securely stored on the client side and sent with each request to authenticate and authorize user access to protected resources.

**Authorization:** This parts is mostly related with the role of the person that is going to log in on the software(user or admin) where the role based access will control the actions of the both sides and limit their functions.
