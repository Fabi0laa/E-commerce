# Project Details

## Project Title: SkinBlissðŸŒ·

## Team Member: Fabiola Vedra. I plan to develop this software independently, thus I will perform all the tasks on my own.

## Problem Statement:
In our nation there are many skincare product distribution companies, or to put it more specifically, internet businesses. These companies distribute various brands, but they are all afflicted by the same issue: a lack of customer transparency. What does this mean? Most of the time, we have observed that the online companies that we mentionedÂ earlier provide their clients with goods that they may not even need, or worse, that are not beneficial for their particular issue or face type, all in the name of making a profit. You might be wondering why the clients don't visit a dermatologist at this point. Dermatologists are not very common here in Albania, where we consider them to be not necessary as well as expensive. Also as there are a lot of cases where dermatologists have caused also bigger problems, than to have actually helped clients with their issue. In addition, dermatologists are typically more helpful with more severe cases of skin issues than with people who just want to maintain their skin or have minor issues that can be resolved with the right products. This brings us to a list of all the online retailers of skincare products. As we previously mentioned, many of them are not transparentÂ with their customers and may not provide the correct solution for their needs, instead offering them something that they already mayÂ have in stock.

## Solution Proposed:
I've decidedÂ to develop aÂ software that will allow customers to browse a wide range of products from different brands,from the most affordable to the most luxurious,Â categorizedÂ by function,Â effect, price, reviews ets. This E-commerce platform tends to help customers choose the right products for their skin issues by offering a user-friendly interface, problem-based recommendations, and a curated selection of products that help to diverse skin concerns.

## Project Scope:
- **Aim:** Establishing software that offers a wide range of products and, at the same time, a vast database of information about every skin condition and the products that are best suited to address. Thus, weÂ will help users to make safe and informed skincare decisions, minimizingÂ the possibility of misinformationÂ coming from other sources and fostering confidence in users during their shopping experience.

- **Main Objectives:**
1. Quick Solutions Access: Developing a reliable website where people can easily and rapidly find solutions to their skin issues, free from external influences while having information available for every scenario possible.
2. User-Friendly Software: Create a user-friendly software that will be easy to use by all customers.
3. Optimized Shopping Visibility: Optimize user's shopping experience by improving the visibility of products through specific placement and search optimization, for faster and efficient product discovery.
4. Trustworthy Reviews Section: Increase the website's credibility by adding a review section where actual clients can post feedback and reviews about each product, helping new buyersÂ make informed decisions.
5. Transparency: We're here to redefine standards and ensure your skincare choices are backed by reliable, no-nonsense information, and most importantly not influenced by other people, besides yourself. 
6. Diverse Product Range: Expand the product catalog to serve to a diverse range of skin concerns and types.
7. High Privacy and Security: Provide theÂ highest levels of user privacy and data security by usingÂ user authentication, strong password requirements,Â and other advanced security features.

- **Application Description:**
SkinBlissðŸŒ·- A versatile online shopping platform with user authentication,extensive item catalog, and user-friendly experience!âœ¨
As previously pointed out, I plan to create a web applicationÂ that will include a wide variety of skincareÂ products. The website will start with a home page that will contain the information for the web aplilication and will lead to the other pages. The software will be divided into categories dedicated to various skin problems. Within each section will be product recommendations for each step of the skincare routine, from cleansersÂ to face creams, serums, masks, and so on. Additionally, each product will be categorizedÂ for its own purpose; for example, cleansers of various brands will be placed in the cleansers category, moisturizersÂ in their category, etc. But, for those who already know what they want to buy, we will create a search bar. Each client will have the ability to set up an account, which they can use to log in and place orders at a later time. To create an account the user will need credentials such as, name, surname, phone number, email and password, while to log in again will only be needed the username, or phone number and the password. On the order page, you can see the products you have already added to your card and change their quantity.  Next, users will fill out their address information and can confirm the order. Additionally, the user has access to see orders that have already been placed and those that are currently being delivered. It will offer to the users ease on choosing what they need and safety for their data and private informations. This is an overview of the web application's most significant features; it will have additional features as well.
