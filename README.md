# E-commerce
Repo: E-commerce- A versatile online shopping platform with user authentication,extensive item catalog, and user-friendly experience!✨
✔Team Member: Fabiola Vedra. I plan to develop this software independently, thus I will perform all the task on my own.
✔Identified Problem:In our nation there are many skincare product distribution companies, or to put it more specifically, internet businesses. These companies distribute various brands, but they are all afflicted by the same issue: a lack of customer transparency. What does this mean? Most of the time, we have observed that the online companies that we mentioned earlier provide their clients with goods that they may not even need, or worse, that are not beneficial for their particular issue or face type, all in the name of making a profit. 
You might be wondering why the clients don't visit a dermatologist at this point. Dermatologists are not very common here in Albania, where we consider them to be not necessary as well as expensive. Also as there are a lot of cases where dermatologists have caused also bigger problems, than to have actually helped clients with their issue. In addition, dermatologists are typically more helpful with more severe cases of skin issues than with people who just want to maintain their skin or have minor issues that can be resolved with the right products. This brings us to a list of all the online retailers of skincare products. As we previously mentioned, many of them are not transparent with their customers and may not provide the correct solution for their needs, instead offering them something that they already may have in stock.
✔Proposed Solution:I've decided to develop a software that will allow customers to browse a wide range of products from different brands,from the most affordable to the most luxurious, categorized by function, effect, price, reviews ets. This E-commerce platform tends to help customers choose the right products for their skin issues by offering a user-friendly interface, problem-based recommendations, and a curated selection of products that help to diverse skin concerns.
✔Aim:
